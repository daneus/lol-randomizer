# About

This application draws a completely random League of Legends build, including:

- Champion
- Role
- Summoner spells
- Ability to Max
- Build
- Runes

# **No Impossible Builds!**

The randomizing algorithm prevents impossible builds from being drawn. Examples of impossible builds:

- **Jungle** being drawn as the random role without **Smite** on the summoners
- **Ranged** champions with **Runaan's Hurricane**
- **Cassiopeia** with **boots** or **Magical Footwear**
- **Energy users** with **Presence of Mind**
- Double unique items on the same build, like **Infinity Edge** and **Guinsoo's Rageblade**
